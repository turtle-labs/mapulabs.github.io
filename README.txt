This website is made for educational purposes only. It's an assignment for a web development course on coursera.com.

Everything is coded from scratch. The page and its functions has been tested multiple times before the final upload.

Pages are validated at "https://validator.w3.org/" with no errors. There's only a handful of non-essential warnings. Feel free to check below:

Pages are validated at "https://wave.webaim.org/" with no critical errors. The erros that occur are due to the icons in my footer being sourced using CSS and not HTML. Feel free to check below:

All pages are coded for mobile-first-viewport, but optimized for high-definition (HD) as well.

Images displayed on the website, comes with a payed standard license through Adobe Stock.

The video background comes with a free license from Pixabay.com.

At some point in time I will convert the JavaScript code to Classes instead, but it's not a part of the assignment.

Best regards // Enjoy your day in the Matrix.
